    "\n",
    "To train and evaluate two models using historical police data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crime Urgency Classifier**\n",
    "   - Predicts the urgency level of a reported crime (**Low**, **Medium**, **High**).\n",

    "- Smarter, real-time crime report handling\n",
    "- Realistic urgency flags and estimated police arrival times\n",

    "###  Step 6: Evaluating the Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the performance of our emergency response time predictor, we evaluated the model using three standard regression metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Metrics Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average difference between predicted and actual response times. Lower is better.\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily. Useful when we want to avoid large under- or over-estimations.\n",
    "- **R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)**: Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target variable. A score closer to 1 means better fit.\n",

    "##  Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we built two key machine learning models to power the **TravelAware** real-time safety assistant:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crime Urgency Classification Model**  \n",
    "   Predicts the urgency level (High / Medium / Low) of a reported crime based on time, location, and type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emergency Response Time Regression Model**  \n",
    "   Estimates the expected response time (in minutes) from authorities for a reported incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- Data cleaning and time-based feature engineering were crucial for meaningful insights.\n",
    "- Categorical variables were transformed via encoding for compatibility with tree-based models.\n",
    "- Both models used **Random Forest** for robust, interpretable results without extensive tuning.\n",
    "- The trained models were exported using `joblib` for easy deployment into a Streamlit application.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models enhance the app‚Äôs ability to provide users with **real-time, data-driven safety insights**, making it a valuable tool for tourists, students, and locals navigating unfamiliar or risky areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Next Steps\n",
    "- Integrate these models into the final Streamlit app interface.\n",
    "- Add geolocation-triggered alerts, SOS functionality, and personalized safety feeds.\n",
    "- Continuously monitor and retrain models using fresh data for improved accuracy over time.\n",
